# fdb â€” my <em>f</em>irst database

Tiny database for a school project.

## Dataset for tests

Though this database supports arbitrary user-defined schemas, while being
developed, we used the Lichess database for testing purposes. If you also want
to use such a dataset for testing purposes, you may download it at
https://database.lichess.org. Follow the instructions on how to decompress the
archive.

Hence, while not related to the database implementation, this repository also
provides a script to parse the unpacked [PGN] file and ingest it into the
database.
