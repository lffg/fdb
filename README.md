# fdb â€” my **f**irst database

Tiny database for a school project.

## Dataset for tests

Though this database supports arbitrary user-defined schemas while being
developed (at the time with a hard-coded schema), we used the Lichess database
for testing purposes.

If you also want to use such dataset for testing purposes, you may download the
dataset at https://database.lichess.org. I suggest downloading the oldest
archive since it is the smallest one. Follow the instructions on how to
decompress the archive.

This repository also provides a script to parse the unpacked [PGN] file and
ingest it into the database.
